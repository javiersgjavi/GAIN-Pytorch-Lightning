## How to run it:

To run the pipeline for training and evaluation on GAIN framework, simply run 
``python3 -m main.py``.

Note that any model architecture can be used as the generator and 
discriminator model such as multi-layer perceptrons or CNNs. 


<a name="creation-of-a-docker-container"/>

### Creation of a Docker container:

If you want to run the code in a Docker container, you can use the following commands:

1. Give execution permissions to the setup.sh file:
```shell
$ chmod +x setup.sh
```
2. Run the setup.sh file:

```shell
$ ./setup.sh
```

If you have exited the container, you can access it again by running the setup.sh file again.

### Command inputs:

-   ``data_name``: letter, spam, credit, breast or news
-   ``miss_rate``: probability of missing components
-   ``batch_size``: batch size
-   ``hint_rate``: hint rate
-   ``alpha``: hyperparameter
-   ``iterations``: iterations

<a name="example-command"/>

### Example command

```shell
$ python3 main.py --data_name spam 
--miss_rate: 0.2 --batch_size 128 --hint_rate 0.9 --alpha 100
--iterations 10000
```

## How to replicate the results of the original paper:

If you want to replicate the results of the table 1 of the original paper, you can use the following command:

```shell
$ python3 replicate_table1_paper.py
```
